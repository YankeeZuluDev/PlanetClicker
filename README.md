# PlanetClicker
This is a coockie clicker clone game, made to show my ability to create web requests and implement firebase realtime database in Unity 

Note: The google-services.json and Firebase SDK files have been intentionally removed from this project due to security concerns. As a result, functionalities related to saving/loading data from my Firebase database within Unity are currently disabled. However, once this game is published on Google Play, you will be able to interact with my instance of the Firebase database.
